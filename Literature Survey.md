# Literature Survey

Paper reading skills are tested by performing a literature survey. To do this, tens of papers will need to be read, perhaps in an unfamiliar field. Which papers should you read? You can use the [[Three-Pass Approach]] to help.

First, use an academic search engine like Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find **3-5** *recent* papers in the area. Perform a [[First Pass]] on each paper to get the gist of the work, then read their related work sections. Upon completing this you will find a thumbnail summary of the recent work. If you are lucky, you may find a pointer to a recent survey paper. If you can find such a survey paper, you are finished!
*Read the survey, congratulating yourself on your good luck*.

If you cannot find such a paper, progress to the second step. Find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. These are key papers and researchers in that area. Download the key papers and set them aside. Next, go to the websites of the key searchers and see where they have published recently. That will help you identify the top conferences in that field. This is because the best researchers usually publish in the top conferences.

The third step is to go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings. With a quick scan, you will typically discover recent high-quality work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, will constitute the first version of your survey. Use the [[First Pass]] and [[Second Pass]] of the [[Three-Pass Approach]] on these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, find it and read it, iterating as necessary.
