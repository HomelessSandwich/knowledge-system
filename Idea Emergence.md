# Idea Emergence

## Level 1
Collecting from the primordial idea soup (sources, ideas, interactions, insights). New ideas solidify into unique notes.

### Making Atomic Notes
Here's a basic [[Zettelkasten]] of atomic notes without links yet. Sole are placeholders, some half-formed. These are ideas without structure.

### Divergence
From the collection and extraction phase, new ideas solidify into unique shapes. Some divergence, convergence and emergence happens naturally here. There is not a clear perspective.

### Linking Atomic Notes
here's a more connected [[Zettelkasten]] showing some atomic notes with bi-directional links. Some better built notes are starting to become [[Evergreen Notes| evergreen]].
