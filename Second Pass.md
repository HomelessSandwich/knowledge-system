# The Second Pass
With this second pass, you should read the paper with more care, ignoring details like proofs. Jotting down key points and making comments in the margins as you read can help.

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labelled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.
2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

The second pass should take around **1 hr**. You should be able to summarise the main ideas of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else. Obtaining this level of detail would be good for a paper in which you are interested but does not reside in your research speciality.

There will be times where you do not understand the paper at the end of the second pass. This can be because the subject content is new to you, with unfamiliar terminology and acronyms. The paper may also be poorly written with unsubstantiated assertions and many forward references. *Or you could just be tired as it is late at night*!

If you have run out of time can choose to:
1. Set the paper aside, hoping you do not need to understand the material to be successful in your career.
2. Return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material.
3. Persevere and go on to the [[Third Pass]].
