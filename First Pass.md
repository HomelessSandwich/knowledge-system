# The First Pass
The first pass is meant to be a quick scan through the paper to get a bird's-eye view. This can also be used to determine if you need to do any more passes. This should take **5-10** mins and consists of the following steps:
1. Carefully read the title, abstract and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings but ignore everything else
3. Read the conclusions
4. Glance over the references and in your head, tick off the ones you have already read

There are five *Cs* that you should be able to answer after this first pass:
1. *Category*: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
2. *Context*: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyse the problem?
3. *Correctness*: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. *Contributions*: What are the paper's main contributions?
5. *Clarity?*: Is the paper well written?

With this first pass, you may choose to not read further. This is fine, for the following reasons. Perhaps the paper is not of interest, you do not know enough to understand the paper or the assumptions are invalid. The first pass should be adequate if the paper is not in your research area but may one day be relevant.
