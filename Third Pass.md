# The Third Pass

To fully understand a paper, especially if you are a reviewer, a third pass is needed. The key to the third pass is to ***attempt to virtually re-implement the paper***. You do this by making the same assumptions and recreate the work. With this, you can compare this work with the original paper. This comparison can be used to easily identify the paper's innovations, as well as its hidden failings and assumptions.

This pass demands great attention to detail. You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. Furthermore, you should think yourself how you would present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends deep insight into the proof and presentation techniques used in the paper. With this, you can add them to your repertoire of tools. You should also note down ideas for future work.

This pass can take about **four to five hours** for beginners and about an hour for the experienced. Moreover, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. Pinpointing implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques should be of particular focus.
