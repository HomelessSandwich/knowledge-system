It is a rule that you cannot start a sentence with a present form of the verb *съм* ("to be"). When you omit the subject personal [[20230129210911-a|pronoun]], the [[20230129214114|verb]] has to move into the second position:
- "Аз съм мъж" or "Мъж съм" – I am a man

It is incorrect to say: "съм мъж"
