The си can be used to refer to one's own. In English for example, "he likes his dog" could mean he likes his own dog or he likes someone else's dog. As only context could indicate what is meant, in Bulgarian you choose been му and си:

>"Той харесва кучето си" - He likes his (own) dog
>
>"Той харесва кучето му" - He likes his (another man's) dog
