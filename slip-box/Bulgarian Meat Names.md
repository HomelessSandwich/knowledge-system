Words like:
- говеждо месо (beef meat)
- свинско месо (pork meat)

Can be written in shorthand [[Fact Adjective|fact adjectives]] as:
- говеждо (beef)
- свинско (pork)

This is because it is obvious we are talking about meat. The [[Adjective|adjective]] alone can be used as a [[Noun|noun]]. These words are [[Bulgarian Grammatical Gender|neutral]] because of месо.

Пиле (chicken) refers to the animal but it is also very common for it to refer to the meat. The adjective would be пилешко. Пиле and пилешко can be used interchangeably but пилешко can be used to refer to a particular cut. For example: пилешко филе (chicken fillet).
