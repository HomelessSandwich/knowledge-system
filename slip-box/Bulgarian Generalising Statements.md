It sounds more natural in Bulgarian to:
- Use [[Bulgarian Definite Articles|definite forms]] for subjects
- Use non-definite forms for objects when making generalising statements

Example:
> women like cats
> 
> жени**те** харесват котки

The subject has the **-те** [[Bulgarian Definite Articles|definite article]] and the object does not.
