When splitting a decision tree, the number of samples that the leaves on a branch can possess can become quite low. This can make it hard to be sure that the leaf will do a good job of making good predictions.

This can be dealt with by:
- [[Decision Tree Pruning|Pruning]]
- Putting limits on how [[20230227115732-c|trees grow]] by setting a threshold of the number of samples required to split a leaf

Example:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Loves popcorn\nSamples: 100]
    C[Does not love the song\nSamples: 80]
    D[Loves cats\nSamples: 20]
    E[Loves the song\nSamples: 19]
    F[Does not love the song\nSamples: 1]

    A --> |True| D
    A --> |False| C

    D --> |True| E
    D --> |False| F
```
