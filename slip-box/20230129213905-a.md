Verbs do not have an [[Infinitive|infinitive]] form. When referring to a [[Verb|verb]], use the first person [[Conjugation|conjugation]] of that [[Verb|verb]]. Here are examples Bulgarian the [[Citation Form|citation form]] "to be".

Example:
- "to be" is "съм"
- Съм is used for the citation form and for "I am"

Two conjugations of "съм":
- I am - Аз съм
- he/she/it is - той/тя/то е

Examples:
- "Той е мъж" - He is a man
- "Тя е жена" - She is a woman
- "Това е куче" - This is a dog

Since the [[Conjugation|conjugations]] are unique to each subject, the [[Pronoun|pronoun]] can be left out:
- Instead of "аз съм мъж" (I am a man), you can say "мъж съм"
