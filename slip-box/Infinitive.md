Infinitives are a special form of [[Verb|verbs]] that can be used as a [[Noun|noun]], [[Adjective|adjective]] or [[Adverb|adverb]]. They are usually made by adding the word *to* before the base verb. They are useful when discussion actions without actually doing the action:
- I want to go home.
- I like to write in English.

Example:
- I need **to win**.
- Today, we win.

In the first sentence, the infinitive form of the [[Verb|verb]] *win* is used. The main [[Verb|verb]] of the sentence is actually "need". The second sentence uses the standard form of *win* as an actionable [[Verb|verb]]. In he first sentence with the infinitive, the action of "winning" is not actually done. The sentence simply discusses the idea of winning. The second sentence however, describes the action of winning.
