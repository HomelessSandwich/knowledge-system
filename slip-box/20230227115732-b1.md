The maximum [[20230227115732-b|gini impurity]] of a decision tree leaf occurs when a leaf is correct only 50% of the time. This means that the maximum gini impurity is `0.5`. Conversely, the minimum gini impurity is `0`. This happens when the leaf is correct 100% of the time.

Example:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Loves popcorn]
    A --> |True| B[Loves the song\nCorrect predictions: 100\nIncorrect predictions: 0\nGini impurity: 0]
    A --> |False| C[Deos not love the song\nCorrect predictions: 50\nIncorrect predictions: 50\nGini impurity: 0.5]
```
