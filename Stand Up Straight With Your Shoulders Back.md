# Rule 1: Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back
## Lobsters - And Territory
- Lobster's simple nervous system has helps us understand the structure and function of the brain and behavior of more complex animals.
- They want a home that's secure.
- This can be a problem as there are potentially many other lobsters wanting to do the same.

## Birds -- And Territory
- Lobsters and birds are obsessed with stats and position.
- The wiliest, strongest , healthiest and most fortunate birds occupy prime territory and defend it.
- With this, they are more likely to attract high-quality mates and have chicks who will survive and thrive.
- Territory matters, with there being little difference between territorial rights and social status.
	- It's a matter of life and death.
- [[Jordan Peterson| Peterson]] makes the point that the least **dominant** and the most **stressed** birds are the most likely to be stricken and die. He extends this to human neighbourhoods. This is because they are more susceptible to non-infectious diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.
- Short supply leads to territory-seeking animals to product conflict.
- As conflict can cause two animals to both lose out (due to injuries etc), this produces the following problem:
> How to win or lose without incurring too great a cost?

## Conflict and Territory
- Animals have learned many tricks to establish dominance, whilst reducing the least amount of possible dominance.
- Lobsters have 4 stages of this, with the fourth involving serious combat and a clear winner and loser. They attempt to establish dominance as they explore, trying to find the ideal secure place to live.
- If a dominant lobster is badly defeated, its brain basically dissolved, growing a new subordinate brain.
- This is more appropriate to its new, lowly position. Its original brain isn't sophisticated enough to manage the transformation from king to bottom dog without virtually complete dissolution and regrowth. 
- [[Jordan Peterson| Peterson]] extends this to  the painful transformation of a serious defeat in romance or career.
