# Short Shifting

Short shifting is a driving technique in which the gear is changed up before reaching maximum engine RPM. By short shifting, the engine does not reach its power band, and therefore maximum vehicle acceleration is not attained for the gear from which the short shift was performed.

In racing, short-shifting is a technique intended to avoid losing valuable acceleration time changing gears later.

## Application to F1
Short shifting can help to avoid loss of traction. F1 cars can easily spin out, if the power is too sudden.
