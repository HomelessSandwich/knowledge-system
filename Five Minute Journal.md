# Five Minute Journal

Instead of writing a stream of consciousness, spend five minutes writing a few bullet points. This should take place in the morning in response to some prompts.

## Prompts
- What am I grateful for?
- What would make today great?
- What am I worried about?

### What Am I Grateful for?
- Reflect on the good things happening in your life lately
	- These can be some things, like:
		- Nice weather
		- Sleeping well
		- Watching a great TV show
	- They can be bigger things, like:
		- Appreciating your family
		- Having good health
		- Stable job

These can be repetitive but can help you to be in a positive state of mind for the day.

### What Would Make Today Great?
- This prompt can be used as a mini-plan for the day
- Define at least 3 "must-do" tasks + a set of achievable goals and activities
	- If completed, this would make for a successful day

### What Am I Worried About?
- Writing down what your are concerned about or problem areas in your life can help to stop ruminating or thinking about it throughout the day
- When your recognise a problem, it isn't the best time to solve it
- Knowing you are going to return and create an action plan prevents it from being intrusive throughout the day

Over time, have a look at all these entries to see if there are any common themes.

## Extra Journaling
If you can complete the 5 minute journal, you ca add on a few additional writing practices.

### Evening Questions
These prompts are similar to the morning journal. These allow for reflection at the end of the day.

- How am I feeling?
- What's something good that happened today?
- What did I do well?
- What could I have done better?

#### How Am I Feeling?
Subjectively rate each day on a scale of 0-10 depending on how happy and productive you were.

#### What's Something Good that Happened Today?
This is here to put you in a positive state of mind before bed. It's similar to the gratitude entry but for at least one specific thing that happened during the day.

#### What Did I Do Well?
Reflect on what you did well and what you tried that was successful.

#### What Could I Have Done Better?
Spend some time reflecting on what didn't go well and how you could do better next time. If you didn't go through with something or do something that moves you further away from your goals, like breaking your diet, acknowledge it and think about what you should have done instead.
