# Three-Pass Approach

The main idea of the three-pass approach is to read a paper within three passes. This stops time being wasted by starting from the beginning and ploughing through to the end. Each pass should accomplish a specific goal, building upon the previous pass. ***[[First Pass]]*** gives you a general idea of the paper. ***[[Second Pass]]*** allows you to understand the paper's content but not its details. ***[[Third Pass]]*** is used in order to understand a paper in depth.
