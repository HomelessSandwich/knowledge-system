## Evening Questions

### How Am I feeling?
6

### What's Something Good That Happened Today?
- I started to read Jordan Peterson
- Had a good talk with Dan
- Got the TFT project started with him

### What Did I Do Well?
- I (maybe) gave good advice to Dan
- Think I had a good project management mentality

### What Could I Have Done Better?
- Clem got angry with me for being a "smart-arse", which was partially the case but also not completely fair
	- I should do a better job of articulating my point
	- He got angry as I do, in a "smart-arse" way, correct people's language to the "proper" British way of doing things
	- I was merely pointing out however that I didn't remember "Vizio" as being a brand
	- From the recessed of my mind I remembered (incorrectly), that "Visio" could be the alternative
	- He mistook that as me attempting to make his language "proper"
	- To avoid this, I should have articulated the above points clearly
- I overate again today, this was because I didn't go to M&S and spent a lot of money on Gorillas
- I didn't shower either, I didn't shower yesterday, this is not good for my skin
- I washed my bed sheets today and didn't have any others in place, so I will sleep with no sheets
	- Next time, make sure to not be lazy with the other sheets so that this will not be a problem
